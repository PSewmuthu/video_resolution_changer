# Video Resolution Changer

> Increase or Decrease your video resolution

With this python script, you can increase or decrease the resolution of your video. But this script cannot copy audio to output file. I will fix it in the future.

## Usage Example

Run the following command in command prompt or terminal.

        python "Video Resolution Changer.py"

After running the above code, give the video path and resolution changing value.

Then, a new video file(out.avi) will generate automatically with the resolution given by you.
